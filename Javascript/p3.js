//asynchronous events only happen when the js thread is idle using web api, callback queue and event loop

//running something on a console is like running your own js thread and the page won't be updated with any response from the server unless the thread becomes idle 

//promises is just another way of writing asynchronous code more neatly
//normal callback functions be like do this job after x seconds while
//promise be like remind me after x seconds and I will myself do the task

// so in a way it instatly returns the promise and doesn't actually know what task needs to be done
