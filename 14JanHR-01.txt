Tell me about yourself

Hi, I’m Rohit, a passionate and innovative Software Engineer with a strong foundation in computer science and hands-on experience in building cutting-edge web and mixed reality solutions. I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology, where I maintained a CGPA of 8.8/10 and delved deep into subjects like Data Structures, Algorithms, and Database Management Systems.

During my time at Acemicromatic Manufacturing Intelligence Technologies, I worked on a variety of impactful projects, including developing a Web VR experience that reduced costs by 90% and improved rendering efficiency by 35%. I also built Mixed Reality applications for Meta Quest 3, enabling immersive interactions through scene APIs and hand-tracking. Additionally, I developed a chat completion service integrated with GPT-4o, allowing for context-aware responses and multimodal capabilities like image reading and message sending to platforms like Microsoft Teams and WhatsApp.

I’m particularly proud of my work on geolocation-based WebVR experiences, where I created an interactive 3D globe-to-city navigation system with real-time data integration. My ability to optimize performance, automate deployments using CI/CD pipelines, and implement secure authentication systems showcases my technical versatility and problem-solving skills.

Beyond my technical expertise, I’ve also presented a research paper on algorithmic trading at IEEE ICDSIS(International Conference)-2024, which was recognized as one of the best among 106 participants. 
[This reflects my ability to blend technical knowledge with innovative thinking to solve complex problems.]

[I’m excited about the opportunity to bring my skills in software development, mixed reality, and AI-driven solutions to your team, and I’m eager to contribute to creating impactful and scalable technologies.]
