Square root of a number

1. Built in function

2. O(sqrt(n)) by going through the loops

3. using numbers 1, 2, 3, ... n
mid+1*mid+1 == n return mid
mid+1*mid+1 < n low = mid+1
high = mid - 1;



Nth root of a number

::O(NlogM) since we will run loop for finding mid raised to N, rest everything will be same
