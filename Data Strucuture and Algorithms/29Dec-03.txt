Minimum days to make M bouquets

1. O(max*N)

NOTE: ceil((double)nums[i]/num) this thing is getting used a lot, since it helps in comparison that a particular thing will only complete if it is consumed fully

2. replaced max->log(max) and got very close but the catch in the question is that we need to take adjacent flowers only per bouquet
so we used variables which resets to zero if the divison is not according to our needs and we maintained a variable for mcnt and compared this rather in the end for the boolean return.
::(N*log(max))

OBSERVATIONS: if(m*k > N) return -1;
