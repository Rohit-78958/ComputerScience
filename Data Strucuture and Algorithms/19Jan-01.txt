1. Convert vector/array to DLL ::O(n)

first head ptr will contain first element and point to it using some tempHEad
then in for loop use tempHEad for prev ptr and keep updating with temp ptr


2. delete head of LL ::O(1)

null and only one node return nullptr
else head->next->prev=nullptr, head = head->next;
