Agrressive cows

NOTE: this is also a type of b.s. where we need to find max(min) or min(max)

x1 x2 ... xn
and we need to place k cows in any place such that the minimum distance(consecutive cows) between any two cows is maximum

1. naive approach: O(nlogn + (max - min + 1)*n)
because we will sort the array and run the loop from 1  to max - min because that is the max distance which we can get and run the loop for each taken distance and see if it is possible or not.

2. b.s. on answers same 1 ... (max-min) can be done through b.s.
::O(nlogn + n*log(max-min+1))
