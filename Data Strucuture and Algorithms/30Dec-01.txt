Find peak element

1. O(n) direct solution

2. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 5, 1] ::O(logn)
we will apply b.s and move in the direction of greater element always because there is more chance of finding peak element on the greater side

OBSERVATION: search question + better tc than O(N) + some sorted elements => b.s.
we can observe same thing with graph for better observation
we will always get the peak nearest to the mid element

:: all array will always have a peak element unless all elements are equal there
