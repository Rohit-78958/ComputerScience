Count subarrays with given XOR k

1. O(N2) solution by checking all possible subarrays

2. similar to count subarray with sum k, we will look at ending point and try to find (xr ^ k) in the map and increment the counter with the count of searched xor since multiple subarrays can contribute to same result.
::O(nlogn) with space n
