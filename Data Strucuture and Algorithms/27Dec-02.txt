Longest Consecutive sequence in an Array

1. the very first intution that I get is O(n2) I will check all the sequences possible

2. Then another I get is O(nlogn) that is sort and traverse along with two varaibles namely currentLength and maxLength

3. Using an unordered set based on the assumption that collisions will not happen
Then we first insert all the elements ::O(n)
Then we traverse the set and look for the element not having its predecessor and then we keep on incrementing and finding next elements in set and update maxLength :: O(2n)
this gives overall tc  of O(n) with space n
