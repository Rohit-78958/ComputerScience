1. delete element with value X ::O(n)

handle first element case and element not found case separately 
rest do as LL follows


2. Insert at head of LL ::O(1)

head==nullptr handle rest follow LL



3. insert at tail of LL ::O(n)

head==nullptr handle rest follow LL


4. insert at kth position of LL ::O(n)

head == nullptr and k==1 handle rest follow LL



5. insert before the value X in LL

handle 1st node and nullptr LL and X not found rest follow LL
