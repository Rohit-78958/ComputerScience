Reverse LL in group of K

1. reverse the LL in groups of K and change the links accordingly, handle some edge cases and sorted ::O(2n)



Rotate a LL to right by K

1. total forward traversal is (n - k) and rotation is k%n, rest we need change the links, but we need to handle the case of k=0 and k%n==0
::O(2n)
