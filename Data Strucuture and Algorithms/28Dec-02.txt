search insert position ::O(logn)

:: another name for lower bound index retrieval
NOTE: BUILT IN LOWER/UPPER BOUND FUNCTION RETRIEVES THE VALUE ONLY NOT THE INDEX




floor and ceil of an array ::O(logn)

ceil is equivalent to lower_bound with case handling when it will point to end
but floor we need to make and that is upper_bound - 1(because we want equal case also) and we just need to handle the case of begin




First and Last occurence

First occurence was fine and can be handled using lower_bound
For the last occurence we need to use upper_bound with case handling of end

NOTE: ITERATOR - ITERATOR1 GIVES LONG INTEGER, 
      ITERATOR - INTEGER = ITERATOR'
