Find the smallest divisor

1. O(max*N) will be the brute force since the maximum number upto which we can go will be max because post that all the numbers will give same result

2. whenever we need to find min/max/smallest/largest and you know the range ->b.s. on answers
since we know our answer will be in range of [1,2,3,...,max] so we applied b.s. on our possible answers and eliminated halfs based on if we get an answer then post that all will have an answer.
::O(N*log(max))


NOTE: int/int -> int so ceil/floor doesn't work



Koko eating bananas :: (same as above problem) :: O(N*log(max))

OBSERVATIONS: if h == nums.size() then the answer will always be max element
